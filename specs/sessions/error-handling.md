# Error Handling

## Overview

`SessionError` in `error.rs` is the crate's error type, derived via `thiserror`. All
public session methods return `Result<_, SessionError>`.

## SessionError

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum SessionError {
    #[error("Session must be in {} state, current: {current}", format_expected(.expected))]
    InvalidState {
        expected: Vec<SessionState>,
        current: SessionState,
    },

    #[error("Environment '{name}' {action} failed: {reason}")]
    EnvironmentScriptFailed { name: String, action: String, reason: String },

    #[error("Failed to resolve {context}: {reason}")]
    FormatString { context: String, reason: String },

    #[error("Failed to write embedded file '{name}': {source}")]
    EmbeddedFile { name: String, #[source] source: std::io::Error },

    #[error("Failed to create working directory {path}: {source}")]
    WorkingDirectory { path: PathBuf, #[source] source: std::io::Error },

    #[error("Failed to start subprocess '{command}': {source}")]
    SubprocessStart { command: String, #[source] source: std::io::Error },

    #[error("Failed to create temp directory in {path}: {source}")]
    TempDir { path: PathBuf, #[source] source: std::io::Error },

    #[error("{0}")]
    Runtime(String),
}
```

The enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`, allowing new variants to be added without breaking
consumers.

## Variant Design Rationale

### InvalidState

Guards every state transition. The `expected` field is `Vec<SessionState>` because some
operations accept multiple valid states (e.g., `exit_environment` accepts both `Ready`
and `ReadyEnding`). A `format_expected()` helper joins the variants with `" or "` for
display:

```rust
fn format_expected(states: &[SessionState]) -> String {
    match states {
        [single] => single.to_string(),
        _ => states.iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect::<Vec<_>>().join(" or "),
    }
}
```

This produces messages like `"Session must be in READY state"` or
`"Session must be in READY or READY_ENDING state"`.

### EnvironmentScriptFailed

Captures the environment name and action (`"enter"` or `"exit"`) for diagnostics.
The `reason` is typically the subprocess exit code or a format string resolution error.

### FormatString

Wraps errors from `openjd_model::resolve_format_string()` and
`openjd_expr::evaluate_expression()`. The `context` field describes what was being
resolved (e.g., `"action command"`, `"embedded file data for 'MyScript'"`) to help
users locate the problem in their template.

### EmbeddedFile

Wraps `std::io::Error` from file creation, writing, or permission changes. The `name`
field is the embedded file's `name` from the template, not the filesystem path.

### WorkingDirectory and TempDir

Both wrap `std::io::Error` with the path that failed. They're separate variants because
they occur at different lifecycle points (construction vs. cleanup) and may need different
handling by consumers.

### SubprocessStart

Wraps `std::io::Error` from `tokio::process::Command::spawn()`. The `command` field is
the resolved command string, helping diagnose "command not found" errors.

### Runtime

Catch-all for errors that don't fit other variants. Used sparingly — most errors should
have a specific variant. Currently used for:
- LIFO environment exit order violations
- Unexpected internal state

## Error Propagation Patterns

### Runner → Session

Runners return `Result<SubprocessResult, SessionError>`. The session maps these to
state transitions:
- `Ok(result)` with `result.state == Success` → `Ready` (or `ReadyEnding`)
- `Ok(result)` with `result.state == Failed` → `ReadyEnding`
- `Err(e)` → `ReadyEnding` + error logged

### Format string errors

Format string resolution can fail at multiple points:
- `resolve_action_args()` — command/args resolution
- `evaluate_env_vars()` — environment variable resolution
- `write_file_contents()` — embedded file data resolution

All are wrapped in `SessionError::FormatString` with context describing the operation.

### I/O errors

File system operations (temp dir creation, embedded file writes, cleanup) produce
`std::io::Error` values wrapped in the appropriate `SessionError` variant with the
relevant path or name for diagnostics.

## Why thiserror

The `thiserror` crate provides derive macros for `std::error::Error` with `Display`
and `source()` implementations. This is the standard approach in the Rust ecosystem
for library error types — it's zero-cost at runtime and produces clean error messages.

The alternative (`anyhow`) is designed for applications, not libraries, and erases
type information that consumers need for error handling.
